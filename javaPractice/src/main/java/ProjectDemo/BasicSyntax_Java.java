	Java basic syntax rules
	-----------------------
	There are some main syntax rules to follow when programming in Java:
	the file name must be identical to the class name;
	most often each class is in a separate file with a .java extension. Class files are usually grouped into folders. These folders are called packages;
	characters are case sensitive. String is not equal to string;
	The beginning of Java program processing always starts in the main method: public static void main (String [] args). The main () method is a required part of any Java program;
	Method (procedure, function) is a sequence of commands. Methods define the behavior of on object;
	The order of the methods in the program file is irrelevant;
	Keep in mind that the first letter of a class name is in uppercase. If you are using multiple words, use uppercase for the first letter of each word (“MyFirstJavaClass”);
	the names of all methods in Java syntax begin with a lowercase letter. When using multiple words, the subsequent letters are capitalized ("public void myFirstMethodName ()");
	files are saved with class name and .java extension ("MyFirstJavaClass.java");
	In Java syntax, there are delimiters "{...}" that denote a block of code and a new area of ​​code;
	Each code statement must end with a semicolon.
	Java variables and data typesVariables are special entities used to store data. Any data. In Java, all data is stored in variables. You may say a variable is a reserved place or a box to put variable in. Every variable has its data type, name (identifier) and value.

	Data types can be primitive and non-primitive or reference. 

	Primitive data types could be:
	Integers: byte, short, int, long
	Fractionals: float and double
	Logical values: boolean
	Symbolic values (for representing letters and numerals): char	*/
